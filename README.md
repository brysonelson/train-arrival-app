# train-arrival-app

Users will need to either login or create an account to login and see the train times.

I used firebase to create and login users. I did not use google for this project.

Once logged in, users will be greeted with a welcome screen showing their username. 

Shortly after that, the train app will load.

Users will be able to see all current train times from any other users in real-time.

There is also the option to add a new train at the bottom. This will automatically update on all users screens.

Lastly, the user can has the options to either clear the current schedule or to log out. Clearing the current 
schedule which will remove all data from the firebase database if the user wants to start from scratch. 
Clicking log out will log out the user and bring them back to the login screen.
